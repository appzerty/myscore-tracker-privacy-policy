      <p><strong>Last updated: 04/15/2025</strong></p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>MyScoreTracker</strong> application collects device
        identifiers (such as device ID, Android ID) for the purpose of app
        functionality and performance analysis. These identifiers are not shared
        with third parties and are not stored in a way that allows
        identification of individual users.
      </p>

      <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        The application does not request any special permissions to operate on
        your device, but it may collect device identifiers necessary for
        functionality and performance improvements.
      </p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>MyScoreTracker</strong> is designed for a general audience and
        can be used by children aged 6 and up. No personal or sensitive data
        from children is collected or shared.
      </p>

      <h2>Sensitive Content</h2>
      <p>
        The application does not contain any sensitive or inappropriate content.
        It is suitable for family use.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        Although we do not collect any personal data, we have implemented
        security measures to ensure the application is safe and respects the
        privacy of all its users, including children. The device identifiers
        collected are stored securely and used solely for the purpose of
        enabling app functionality and improving app performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        The device identifiers collected are stored locally within the app using
        secure storage methods and are not shared with any third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically
        to stay informed.
      </p>
